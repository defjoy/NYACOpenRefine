# NYAC OpenRefine
This four-hour workshop has been adapted from the metadata analysis workshop offered by the Metadata Assessment Working Group at last year's Learn@DLF workshop day. 

As often stated, "OpenRefine is a powerful tool for working with messy data, cleaning it, and transforming it from one format into another." But it is just a tool, so before starting any metadata project, practitioners should think about what they are trying to accomplish. To this end, this workshop begins with a discussion on metadata assessment using the Metadata Assessment Tool developed by the Metadata Assessment Working Group at DLF.
